### What I learned

The hardest part was to style the box-shadow attribute since I haven't learned much about it. The rest is pretty much just dividing each component into different containers and style those.

```css
.card{
    background-color: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
    width: min(87.5%, 22rem);
    margin: 9.5rem auto;
    border-radius: 15px;
    padding: 1.5rem 1.6rem 2rem;
    box-shadow: 0 1rem 3rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

### Continued development

This has been so much easier for me than the first challenge since I'm getting the hang of it. I'll continue to participate in these challenges since they're really fun and my now effort can be useful for the future as I could reuse these as templates.
